Implementation of Lexical Analyzer and LL(1) Parser.
The Lexical Analzer reads stream of characters from source code(sample_code.c) and generates tokens which are witten into tokens.txt.The LL(1) parser reads the tokens and takes appropriate parsing actions to decide whether the string is valid or not.
